# Follow-the-numbers
It appears you are following a set of instructions to organize your game project, save your code, and set up necessary resources like images. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with these tasks:

Create Folders:

Navigate to your "python-games" folder.
Create a new folder inside it and name it "follow-the-numbers."
Save Your Program:

Open your code editor (IDLE or your preferred editor).
Save your Python program as "numbers.py" within the "follow-the-numbers" folder.
Add Image Resources:

Obtain the "dot.png" image from the Python Games Resource Pack you mentioned.
Copy the "dot.png" image into the "images" folder inside your "follow-the-numbers" directory.
Import Required Module:

In your Python code (numbers.py), add the following line at the top to import the randint function from the random module:
python
Copy code
from random import randint
With these steps completed, your game project should be well-organized, and you'll be able to use the "dot.png" image as needed in your game.
To set the screen size for your game, you can define the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` variables at the top of your Python code (numbers.py). Here's how you can do it:

```python
from random import randint

# Set the screen size
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 400

# Rest of your code...
```

By declaring `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` as global variables and assigning the desired pixel dimensions, you are specifying the screen size for your game as 400x400 pixels. You can adjust these values to your preferred screen size as needed for your game.
To set up the Actors for your game, which are the dots, and create them in a loop, you can follow the instructions and add the code as described below. Place this code under the previous steps in your "numbers.py" file:

```python
# Initialize the lists to store dots and lines
dots = []
lines = []

# Variable to keep track of which dot should be clicked on next
next_dot = 0

# Create and position the dots in a loop
for dot in range(0, 10):
    actor = Actor("dot")  # Create a new Actor using the dot image
    actor.pos = (randint(20, WIDTH - 20), randint(20, HEIGHT - 20))
    dots.append(actor)
```

This code initializes the `dots` and `lines` lists, sets up the `next_dot` variable to track the next dot to be clicked, and then creates ten dots using a loop. The dots are positioned randomly within the specified range to ensure they appear at least 20 pixels away from the screen's edges. Each dot is added to the `dots` list, making it ready for use in your game.

To draw the dots and their number labels on the screen using the `draw()` function, you can follow the instructions and add the code as described below. Place this code below the previous steps in your "numbers.py" file:

```python
def draw():
    screen.fill("black")  # Fill the screen with a black background
    number = 1

    for dot in dots:
        screen.draw.text(str(number), (dot.pos[0], dot.pos[1] + 12))  # Display the dot's number label
        dot.draw()
        number += 1
```

In this code:

- The `screen.fill("black")` line fills the screen with a black background.
- A `number` variable is used to label each dot, starting from 1.
- The `for` loop iterates through each dot in the `dots` list.
- Inside the loop, `screen.draw.text()` is used to display the dot's number label just below the dot's position.
- Finally, `dot.draw()` is called to draw the dot on the screen.

This code will ensure that the dots and their corresponding number labels are displayed on the screen as expected.

To draw the lines between the dots, you can add the following code at the end of your existing `draw()` function:

```python
    number += 1
    for line in lines:
        screen.draw.line((100, 0, 0), line[0], line[1])
```

Make sure to add this code below the existing code in your `draw()` function. This code iterates through the `lines` list and draws lines connecting the dots based on the coordinates stored in the list.

With this addition, your game will draw lines between the dots when they are connected, enhancing the gameplay experience.
