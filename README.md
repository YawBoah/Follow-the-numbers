# 🌟 Connect the Dots Game 🌟
Welcome to the **Connect the Dots Game**! This is an interactive and fun game where you connect dots in a sequence. The game is built using Python and the Pygame Zero library.

## 🎮 How to Play
The game is simple yet engaging. You are presented with a screen filled with numbered dots. Your task is to click on the dots in ascending order as fast as you can. Each time you click on the correct dot, a line is drawn to the next dot. But be careful! If you click on the wrong dot, the game resets and you have to start over.

## 📝 Code Explanation
Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

- `import randint`: This line imports the randint function from the random module, which is used to generate random positions for the dots.

- `WIDTH = 400` and `HEIGHT = 400`: These lines set the width and height of the game window.

- `dots = []` and `lines = []`: These lines initialize the lists to store the dots and lines.

- `next_dot = 0`: This line initializes the variable that keeps track of which dot should be clicked on next.

- `for dot in range(0, 10)`: This loop creates and positions the dots.

- `def draw()`: This function is responsible for drawing the game state onto the screen.

- `def on_mouse_down(pos)`: This function updates the game state when the mouse is clicked. It checks if the correct dot was clicked and updates the lines and next_dot variables accordingly.

## Features
- Dynamic Dots: Ten dynamic dots are randomly positioned on the canvas, ready for your artistic touch.
- Numbered Challenge: Each dot is numbered, presenting you with a thrilling challenge to connect them in the correct sequence.
- Lines of Wonder: As you successfully connect the dots, marvel at the mesmerizing lines that form between them, creating unique and captivating patterns.
  
## How to Play
- Mouse Magic: Click on the dots in numerical order using your mouse to connect them.
