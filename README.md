# Follow-the-numbers
It appears you are following a set of instructions to organize your game project, save your code, and set up necessary resources like images. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with these tasks:

Create Folders:

Navigate to your "python-games" folder.
Create a new folder inside it and name it "follow-the-numbers."
Save Your Program:

Open your code editor (IDLE or your preferred editor).
Save your Python program as "numbers.py" within the "follow-the-numbers" folder.
Add Image Resources:

Obtain the "dot.png" image from the Python Games Resource Pack you mentioned.
Copy the "dot.png" image into the "images" folder inside your "follow-the-numbers" directory.
Import Required Module:

In your Python code (numbers.py), add the following line at the top to import the randint function from the random module:
python
Copy code
from random import randint
With these steps completed, your game project should be well-organized, and you'll be able to use the "dot.png" image as needed in your game.
