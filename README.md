# 🌟 Connect the Dots Game 🌟

Welcome to the **Connect the Dots Game**! This is an interactive and fun game where you connect dots in a sequence. The game is built using Python and the Pygame Zero library.

## 🎮 How to Play

The game is simple yet engaging. You are presented with a screen filled with numbered dots. Your task is to click on the dots in ascending order as fast as you can. Each time you click on the correct dot, a line is drawn to the next dot. But be careful! If you click on the wrong dot, the game resets and you have to start over.

## 📝 Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

- `import randint`: This line imports the randint function from the random module, which is used to generate random positions for the dots.

- `WIDTH = 400` and `HEIGHT = 400`: These lines set the width and height of the game window.

- `dots = []` and `lines = []`: These lines initialize the lists to store the dots and lines.

- `next_dot = 0`: This line initializes the variable that keeps track of which dot should be clicked on next.

- `for dot in range(0, 10)`: This loop creates and positions the dots.

- `def draw()`: This function is responsible for drawing the game state onto the screen.

- `def on_mouse_down(pos)`: This function updates the game state when the mouse is clicked. It checks if the correct dot was clicked and updates the lines and next_dot variables accordingly.

## 🚀 Get Started

Are you ready to test your speed and accuracy? Just run the Python script and start connecting the dots. Enjoy the game and try to beat your high score!

Remember, the faster you are, the higher your score will be. So, get ready, set, and go! 🚀
