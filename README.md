# Follow-the-numbers
It appears you are following a set of instructions to organize your game project, save your code, and set up necessary resources like images. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with these tasks:

Create Folders:

Navigate to your "python-games" folder.
Create a new folder inside it and name it "follow-the-numbers."
Save Your Program:

Open your code editor (IDLE or your preferred editor).
Save your Python program as "numbers.py" within the "follow-the-numbers" folder.
Add Image Resources:

Obtain the "dot.png" image from the Python Games Resource Pack you mentioned.
Copy the "dot.png" image into the "images" folder inside your "follow-the-numbers" directory.
Import Required Module:

In your Python code (numbers.py), add the following line at the top to import the randint function from the random module:
python
Copy code
from random import randint
With these steps completed, your game project should be well-organized, and you'll be able to use the "dot.png" image as needed in your game.
To set up the Actors for your game, which are the dots, and create them in a loop, you can follow the instructions and add the code as described below. Place this code under the previous steps in your "numbers.py" file:

```python
# Initialize the lists to store dots and lines
dots = []
lines = []

# Variable to keep track of which dot should be clicked on next
next_dot = 0

# Create and position the dots in a loop
for dot in range(0, 10):
    actor = Actor("dot")  # Create a new Actor using the dot image
    actor.pos = (randint(20, WIDTH - 20), randint(20, HEIGHT - 20))
    dots.append(actor)
```

This code initializes the `dots` and `lines` lists, sets up the `next_dot` variable to track the next dot to be clicked, and then creates ten dots using a loop. The dots are positioned randomly within the specified range to ensure they appear at least 20 pixels away from the screen's edges. Each dot is added to the `dots` list, making it ready for use in your game.
